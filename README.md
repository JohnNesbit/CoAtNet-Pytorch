# CoAtNet-Pytorch
Pytorch Implementation of CoAtNet. the SOTA image classification model.

This implementation allows for the easy swapping of CoatNet versions and has clear, abundant comments. As well as having a complete version of coatnet here, this repository also
includes testing of that version on CIFAR-100. The testing uses the data augmentations perscribed by the coatnet paper of label smoothing, data mixup and RandAugment.
